This is what to do if you just want a website. (This page is a bit
long, but it's really not that much work.)

### First things

Start by cloning
[the repository for the present site](https://github.com/kbroman/simple_site). (Or,
alternatively, fork it and then clone your own version.)

    git clone git://github.com/kbroman/simple_site
